export interface TelemetryEvent {
  /** Event name (use dot-notation: e.g., 'search.scene', 'stream.join') */

/**
 * Event naming conventions:
 * 
 * Use dot-notation to organize events hierarchically:
 * - search.scene - Scene search performed
 * - search.event - Event search performed
 * - search.post - Post search performed
 * - stream.join - Joined audio stream
 * - stream.leave - Left audio stream
 * - scene.view - Viewed scene details
 * - event.view - Viewed event details
 * - map.zoom - Map zoom level changed
 * - map.move - Map viewport moved
 * 
 * Payload guidelines:
 * - Keep payloads minimal (only essential metadata)
 * - Avoid sensitive content (PII, precise locations, full text)
 * - Example payloads:
 *   - search.scene: { query_length: 5, results_count: 10 }
 *   - stream.join: { room_id: "uuid", duration_ms: 1234 }
 *   - scene.view: { scene_id: "uuid" }
