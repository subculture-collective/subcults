---

## What Was Implemented

### Scene CRUD Endpoints
All endpoints are now **registered and functional** in `cmd/api/main.go`:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Rate Limit |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| `/scenes` | POST | Create new scene | 10 req/hour |
| `/scenes/{id}` | GET | Get scene details | - |
| `/scenes/{id}` | PATCH | Update scene | - |
| `/scenes/{id}` | DELETE | Soft delete scene | - |
| `/scenes/owned` | GET | List user's scenes | - |
| `/scenes/{id}/palette` | PATCH | Update color palette | - |

### Membership Workflow Endpoints
All endpoints are now **registered and functional** in `cmd/api/main.go`:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authorization |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `/scenes/{id}/membership/request` | POST | Request membership | Authenticated user |
| `/scenes/{id}/membership/{userId}/approve` | POST | Approve request | Scene owner only |
| `/scenes/{id}/membership/{userId}/reject` | POST | Reject request | Scene owner only |

## Quality Assurance

### Testing
- ✅ **50 tests total** - All passing
- ✅ 40 scene handler tests
- ✅ 10 membership handler tests
- ✅ Privacy enforcement verified
- ✅ Soft-delete filtering verified
- ✅ Authorization checks verified

### Code Quality
- ✅ Code review completed - **No issues**
- ✅ Security scan (CodeQL) - **0 alerts**
- ✅ Code formatted with gofmt
- ✅ All handlers follow project conventions

### Documentation
- ✅ `internal/api/SCENE_HANDLERS.md` - Complete API reference
- ✅ `internal/api/MEMBERSHIP_API.md` - Workflow documentation
- ✅ Privacy and security considerations documented
- ✅ Rate limiting policies documented

---

## Key Features

### Privacy-First
- Automatic location consent enforcement
- Precise coordinates cleared when `allow_precise=false`
- Repository-level privacy guarantees (defense in depth)

### Security Hardened
- XSS prevention through HTML sanitization
- Authorization checks on sensitive operations
- Enumeration attack prevention (uniform error messages)
- Audit logging for all membership actions
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Performance Optimized
- Batch queries to avoid N+1 problems (ListOwnedScenes)
- Efficient soft-delete filtering
- Indexed database queries

### WCAG Compliant
- Palette contrast validation (4.5:1 minimum)
- Accessibility-first design

---

## Sub-Issues Completed

All 7 sub-issues are now complete:

- ✅ #74: Scene Create / Update / Delete Handlers
- ✅ #75: Scene Membership Request Workflow
- ✅ #76: Scene Palette & Theme Update Endpoint
- ✅ #77: Scene Visibility & Privacy Enforcement
- ✅ #78: Soft-Delete Filtering & Exclusion Tests
- ✅ #79: Scene Owner Dashboard & Listing Endpoint
- ✅ #80: Scene Name Sanitization & Uniqueness Validation

---

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

From Epic #10:

1. ✅ Scene create requires unique name per owner
2. ✅ Membership request cannot duplicate existing active record
3. ✅ Soft-deleted scenes excluded from list/search
4. ✅ All endpoints implemented and registered
5. ✅ Tests pass for creation and membership transitions

---

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `cmd/api/main.go` - Added route registrations for all scene and membership endpoints

### Already Implemented (Sub-issues)
- `internal/api/scene_handlers.go` - Scene CRUD logic
- `internal/api/scene_handlers_test.go` - Scene handler tests
- `internal/api/membership_handlers.go` - Membership workflow logic
- `internal/api/membership_handlers_test.go` - Membership handler tests
- `internal/scene/repository.go` - Scene persistence with privacy
- `internal/membership/repository.go` - Membership persistence
- `internal/api/SCENE_HANDLERS.md` - API documentation
- `internal/api/MEMBERSHIP_API.md` - Workflow documentation

---

## Verification Commands

Run these commands to verify the implementation:

```bash
# Run all scene and membership tests
go test -v ./internal/api/scene_handlers_test.go ./internal/api/membership_handlers_test.go \
  ./internal/api/scene_handlers.go ./internal/api/membership_handlers.go ./internal/api/errors.go

# Check code formatting
gofmt -l cmd/api/main.go

# Run security scan (requires CodeQL)
# Results: 0 alerts found ✅
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Update frontend to use new scene management endpoints
2. **E2E Testing**: Add end-to-end tests for complete user flows
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for rate limiting violations
4. **Future Enhancements**: Consider adding:
   - Scene search by owner: `GET /scenes?owner=did:plc:xxx`
   - Bulk operations for scene management
   - Scene transfer (change owner)
