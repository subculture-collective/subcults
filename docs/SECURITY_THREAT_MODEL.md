## STRIDE Analysis

### 1. Spoofing (Identity Verification)

**Definition:** An attacker impersonates a legitimate user or system component.

#### T-SPOOF-001: JWT Token Forgery
- **Threat:** Attacker creates fake JWT tokens to impersonate users
- **Attack Vector:** Weak signing secret, algorithm confusion attack (HS256 → none)
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Full account takeover, unauthorized access to private scenes
- **Affected Assets:** User accounts, private scenes, payment data
- **Existing Mitigations:**
  - ✅ JWT tokens signed with HS256 using secret key (`JWT_SECRET`)
  - ✅ Algorithm validation enforced (`jwt.SigningMethodHS256.Alg()` check in `internal/auth/jwt.go:109`)
  - ✅ 15-minute access token expiry reduces exposure window
  - ✅ 30-second leeway for clock skew tolerance
  - ✅ Token validation in middleware
- **Risk Score:** **LOW** (well-mitigated)
- **Residual Risk:** Secret compromise due to weak key or leak
- **Recommendations:**
  - ✅ Already requires minimum 32-character secret
  - 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY:** Implement secret rotation with dual-key support (see T-SPOOF-002)
  - ⚠️ Monitor for algorithm confusion attempts in logs
  - ⚠️ Consider migrating to RS256 (asymmetric) for better key management

#### T-SPOOF-002: JWT Secret Exposure
- **Threat:** JWT signing secret leaked through source control, logs, or error messages
- **Attack Vector:** Accidental commit to Git, logging in plaintext, server compromise
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - All tokens can be forged if secret is compromised
- **Affected Assets:** All user accounts, entire platform security
- **Existing Mitigations:**
  - ✅ Secret loaded from environment variable (`JWT_SECRET`)
  - ✅ No secrets in source code
  - ✅ `.env` files in `.gitignore`
  - ✅ Dual-key rotation implemented (`internal/auth/jwt.go`: `NewJWTServiceWithRotation()`)
  - ✅ `JWT_SECRET_CURRENT` / `JWT_SECRET_PREVIOUS` config support (`internal/config/config.go`)
  - ✅ Rotation script (`scripts/rotate-jwt-secret.sh`)
- **Risk Score:** **LOW** (dual-key rotation implemented)
- **Residual Risk:** Operational: rotation must be run periodically
- **Recommendations:**
  - ✅ ~~Implement dual JWT key support~~ (done)
  - ⚠️ Automate secret rotation every 90 days via scheduled job
  - ⚠️ Alert on JWT validation failures (potential compromise indicator)
  - ⚠️ Implement emergency secret invalidation procedure

- **Recommendations:**
  - ⚠️ Implement token revocation list (Redis-backed)
  - ⚠️ Use `HttpOnly` cookies instead of localStorage for tokens
  - ⚠️ Add `SameSite=Strict` cookie attribute
  - ⚠️ Implement token fingerprinting (bind to user-agent + IP hash)
  - ⚠️ Rotate refresh tokens on use (one-time use pattern)

#### T-SPOOF-004: Decentralized Identity (DID) Spoofing
- **Threat:** Attacker claims ownership of another user's DID
- **Attack Vector:** AT Protocol verification bypass, DID document manipulation
- **Impact:** HIGH - Impersonate users, post as others, access private scenes

  - 🔴 Implement DID document signature verification
  - ⚠️ Validate DID ownership on every sensitive operation (not just JWT issuance)
  - ⚠️ Audit DID changes in audit logs
  - ⚠️ Implement DID challenge-response for high-value operations

#### T-SPOOF-005: API Request Forgery (CSRF)

  - ✅ Membership verification for member-only scenes
  - ⚠️ **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Consistent authorization across all endpoints
- **Risk Score:** **MEDIUM** (depends on endpoint coverage)
- **Residual Risk:** Missing authorization checks in some endpoints
- **Recommendations:**
  - 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY:** Implement centralized authorization middleware
  - ⚠️ Create authorization matrix: User role × Resource × Action
  - ⚠️ Audit all CRUD endpoints for authorization checks
  - ⚠️ Automated tests: Attempt cross-user access for every endpoint
  - ⚠️ Use attribute-based access control (ABAC) framework

  - ✅ User role in JWT claims (observed in `web/src/stores/authStore.ts`)
  - ⚠️ **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Admin-only endpoint protection
  - ⚠️ **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Role stored in database vs. JWT-only
- **Risk Score:** **MEDIUM** (role system exists but enforcement unclear)
- **Residual Risk:** Role checks missing from admin endpoints
- **Recommendations:**
  - 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY:** Implement `RequireAdmin` middleware:
    ```go
    func RequireAdmin(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
      return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        claims := auth.GetClaims(r.Context())
        if claims.Role != "admin" {
          http.Error(w, "Forbidden", http.StatusForbidden)
          return
        }
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
      })
    }
    ```
  - ⚠️ Store user roles in database (source of truth)
  - ⚠️ Refresh JWT when user role changes
  - ⚠️ Audit trail for all admin actions
  - ⚠️ Two-factor authentication for admin accounts

#### T-PRIV-003: Scene Owner Privilege Bypass
- **Threat:** Non-owner gains scene management privileges (edit, delete, membership management)

- **Impact:** HIGH - Scene takeover, unauthorized content, membership manipulation
- **Affected Assets:** Scene ownership, scene settings, memberships
- **Existing Mitigations:**
  - ✅ `owner_did` field in scenes table
  - ⚠️ **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Owner check enforcement in all scene management endpoints
- **Risk Score:** **MEDIUM** (owner model exists but enforcement needs verification)
- **Residual Risk:** Inconsistent owner checks
- **Recommendations:**
  - ⚠️ Implement `RequireSceneOwner` authorization check
  - ⚠️ Separate scene "admin" role (delegated management) from owner
  - ⚠️ Audit trail for ownership transfers
  - ⚠️ Require 2FA for scene deletion
  - ⚠️ Implement ownership transfer workflow with acceptance

#### T-PRIV-004: Stripe Connect Account Takeover
- **Threat:** Attacker links their Stripe account to another user's scene
- **Attack Vector:** CSRF on Stripe onboarding flow, state parameter manipulation
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Financial fraud, payment redirection, revenue theft
- **Affected Assets:** Scene payouts, financial transactions, user trust

    // Generate: state = HMAC(scene_id + user_did + nonce, secret)
    // Verify: Validate HMAC before linking Stripe account
    ```
  - 🔴 Require scene owner authentication before onboarding

- **Recommendations:**
  - ⚠️ Verify room permissions before token generation
  - ⚠️ Limit room control actions to scene owner + designated organizers
