## Summary

All epic issues now reference:
- **Canonical epics** from the consolidation map in #416
- **Roadmap #416** instead of deprecated Roadmap #1
- Task-level issues (#298-302, etc.) remain unchanged as they are implementation details

## Implementation

Since the GitHub MCP integration doesn't have write permissions for issue updates, these changes need to be made manually through the GitHub web interface by a repository maintainer.
