# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026

## Introduction

Subcults ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of underground music communities. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information when you use our platform.

**Our Core Principle:** Privacy first. We believe in presence over popularity, and that means respecting your privacy, protecting your location data, and giving you control over your information.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information You Provide Directly

#### Account Information
- **Decentralized Identifier (DID):** We use AT Protocol DIDs for authentication, enabling data portability and reducing platform lock-in
- **Profile Information:** Display name, bio, avatar image, and other optional profile details
- **Scene & Event Data:** Information about scenes you create, events you organize, posts you publish

#### Location Information
- **Coarse Location:** 6-character geohash (~±0.61 km accuracy) for regional discovery without pinpointing exact venues
- **Precise Location (Opt-In Only):** Exact GPS coordinates are **only** stored when you explicitly enable `allow_precise` for a scene or event
- **Default Setting:** `allow_precise = FALSE` — we never store precise coordinates without your explicit consent

#### Media Uploads
- **Images, Audio, Video:** Files you upload for scenes, events, posts, or profile images
- **EXIF Stripping:** All uploaded media has metadata automatically removed before storage to prevent location/device leakage:
  - GPS coordinates embedded in photos
  - Device identifiers (camera make, model, serial numbers)
  - Original timestamps
  - Camera settings metadata

#### Payment Information
- **Stripe Connect:** When you onboard as an artist/organizer, Stripe processes your banking and identity information directly
- **Transaction Data:** We store transaction metadata (amounts, dates, scene/event references) but never store full payment credentials

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically

#### Usage Data
- **Request Logs:** HTTP method, path (no query parameters), status code, latency, response size
- **Request IDs:** UUID correlation identifiers for debugging (from `X-Request-ID` header or auto-generated)
- **Authentication Context:** Your DID when authenticated (for access control and audit trails)

#### Error & Diagnostic Data
- **Client-Side Errors:** Error messages, stack traces, component traces, URL, user agent, session ID
  - **PII Redaction:** JWT tokens, email addresses, DIDs, authorization headers, and API keys are automatically removed before transmission
  - **Rate Limited:** Maximum 10 errors per minute to prevent abuse
- **Session Replay (Opt-In Only):** 
  - **Default:** OFF (you must explicitly enable)
  - **Data Recorded:** DOM changes (sampled 50%), clicks (100%), navigation (100%), scroll (10%)
  - **Privacy Protection:** No text content, no form values, element IDs/classes only, pathname only (no query params)
  - **Transmission:** Only sent when an error occurs AND you have opted in

#### Performance & Analytics (Opt-Out Available)
- **Telemetry Events:** Usage analytics, performance metrics, feature engagement
- **Default:** ON (enabled by default)
- **User Control:** Can be disabled in Settings → Privacy → Analytics
- **Scope:** Aggregated data not tied to individual users after 90 days

### 1.3 Information We Do NOT Collect

We explicitly **do not** log or store:
- IP addresses (except transiently for rate limiting decisions)
- Request bodies or form data
- Full URLs with query parameters
- Authentication credentials or tokens
- User movements or browsing patterns

## 2. How We Use Your Information

### 2.1 Core Platform Functions
- **Identity & Authentication:** Verifying your DID and managing access tokens
- **Scene Discovery:** Displaying scenes and events on the map based on location and trust graph
- **Live Streaming:** Connecting you to LiveKit audio rooms for live performances
- **Payments:** Processing transactions via Stripe Connect for tickets, merchandise, and direct artist support
- **Media Storage:** Storing your uploaded content in Cloudflare R2

### 2.2 Trust & Ranking
- **Alliance System:** Computing trust scores based on your alliances and role multipliers
- **Search Ranking:** Weighting search results by composite score (text relevance, proximity, recency, trust weight when feature-flagged)

### 2.3 Platform Improvement
- **Error Debugging:** Analyzing client-side error logs to identify and fix bugs
- **Performance Optimization:** Using telemetry data to improve load times and responsiveness
- **Feature Development:** Understanding feature engagement to prioritize development

### 2.4 Security & Compliance
- **Access Auditing:** Maintaining security logs for 90 days to detect abuse
- **Rate Limiting:** Preventing API abuse and ensuring fair resource allocation
- **Legal Compliance:** Responding to valid legal requests (e.g., GDPR data subject requests)

## 3. Information Sharing & Third Parties
